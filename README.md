This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## DSPy prompt optimization

The workbench now supports optimizing Gemini prompts with **DSPy 3 + GEPA** in addition to the original handwritten prompt.

1. Install the Python tooling once per environment:
   ```bash
   pip install -r python/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Provide a `GEMINI_API_KEY` so both Next.js and DSPy can reach Gemini models.
3. In the **Options** panel use the new *Prompt Strategy* toggle to switch between manual prompts and DSPy GEPA optimization.
4. Generation results will surface which strategy ran along with GEPA coverage/score stats.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
